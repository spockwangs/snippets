This directory contains the code which implements various data structures
and algorithms described in the book "Introduction to Algorithms", 2/e.
They are coded when I study the book.

The hierarchy is as follows.

    +-inc/      include head files
    +-src/      C source files
    +-test/     test code
    +-Makefile  compiling file
    +-README    this file
    +-libalgo.a archive of all objectives of source codes
