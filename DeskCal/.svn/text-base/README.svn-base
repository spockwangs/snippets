Introduction
------------

This code implements a simple desk calculator.  It comes from chapter 6 of
"The C++ Programming Language, Third Edition".  It exmplifies a
recursive-descent (or predictive parsing) parser.

dc2.cpp is a rewritten version using C-style.

Usage
-----

Type "make" to compile it.  

Then run it, and type inputs (inputs are simple
mathematical expressions, just support plus, minus, multiplication and
division and parentheses) then <Enter> and it displays the result of the
expression you inut.  

Type EOF to end the process.
